INTRODUCTION                                                         *redhawk*


NOTE: Redhawk must be installed in your path.
Redhawk can be installed via PyPi: 
  $ pip install redhawk

The project hompage is here:http://pypi.python.org/pypi/redhawk
Currently, only redhawk replace are supported.
EXAMPLE USAGE:

1. Query for '**/DefineFunction' in each FILE:
  Redhawk query '**/DefineFunction' [FILE]

2. Replace all results for '**/DefineFunction' in buffers:
  RedhawkBuf replace '**/DefineFunction'

3. Query parallely for '**/DefineFunction' in each FILE:
  Redhawk query '**/DefineFunction' [FILE] -p

List of Commands:
Redhawk:        Query and replace from within Vim.
RedhawkAdd:     Add to quick fix list.
RedhawkArgs:    Add args as files to redhawk command.
RedhawkBuf:     Add files in buffers to redhawk command.
RedhawkArgsAdd: (similar)
RedhawkBufAdd:  (similar)

If you do not have redhawk installed on your path, you could set it to
/path/to/redhawk by setting the g:redhawk_program variable. Optional arguments
that you might always want to use are set in g:redhawk_args. If you find that
the default behaviour of the quickfix list popping up irritating, you can set
g:redhawk_open_resultlist to 0 in your .vimrc
