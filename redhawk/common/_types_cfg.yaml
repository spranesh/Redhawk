# YAML markup for generating the types classes.
# Each node must be a subclass of Type.
# The output classes generated are in alphabetical order.
#
# The following attributes are allowed (the sexp attribute is compulsory, all
# others optional). The defaults are as show in the square brackets.)
#   * sexp              (a yaml list)
#   * super [Node]      (a single class to inherit from)
#   * docstring ['']    (a single line doc string)
#   * args ['']         (a cs-list)
#   * children ['']     (a cs-list)
#   * xml ['']          (a yaml list)
#   * json ['']         (a yaml list)
#   * dot ['']          (a yaml list)
#   * optargs ['']      (a cs-list)
#
# A cs-list is a comma+space separated list like as follows
#   this, is, a, comma, separated, list
# This has been introduced only to make entry easier.
